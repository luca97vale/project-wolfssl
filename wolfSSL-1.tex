\chapter{SSL Protocol}

\section{Introduction}
The SSL protool is a client/server protocol that provides the following basic security services to the communicating peers:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Authentication (both peer entity anda data origin authentication) services
	\item Connection confidentiality services
	\item Connection integrity services
\end{itemize}

The SSL protocol is sockets-oriented, meaning that all or none of the data that is sent to or received from a network connection is cryptographically protected in exactly the same way. It can be best viewed as an intermediate layer between the transporrt and the application layer that serves two purposes:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Establish a secure connection between the commucating peers
	\item Use this connection to securely trasmit giher-layer protocol data from the sender to the reciever. It therefore fragments the data in pieces called fragments; each fragment is optionally compressed, authenticated, encrypted, prepended with a header, and transmitted to the reciever. Each data fragment prepared this way is sent in a distinct SSL record.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{subLayer_subProtocols.png}
    \caption{The SSL with its (sub)layer and (sub)protocols}
    
\end{figure}

The SSL consists of two sublayers and a few subprotocols:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The lower sublayer is stacked on top of some connection-oriented and reliable transport layer protocol. This layer basically comprises the SSL record protocol that is used for the encapsulation of the higher-layer protocol data.
	\item The higher sublayer is stacked on top of the SSL record protocol and comprises four subprotocols.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item The \emph{SSL handshake protocol} is the core subprotocol of SSL. It is used for establishment of a secure connection. It allows the communicating peers to authenticate each other and to negotiate a cipher suite and a compression method.
		\item The \emph{SSL change cipher spec protocol} is used to put the parameters, set by the SSL handshake protocol in place and make them effective.
		\item The \emph{SSL alert protocol} allows the communicating peers to signal indicators of potential problems and send respective alert messages to each other.
		\item The \emph{SSL application data protocol} is used for the secure transmission of application data.
	\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

In spite of the fact that SSL consists of several subprotocols, we use the term \emph{SSL protocol} to refer to all of them simultaneously.

\section{SSL Handshake}
The SSL handshake protocol is layered on top of the SSL record protocol. It allows a client and server to authenticate each other and to negotiate issues like cipher suites and compression methods.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{handshake.png}
    \caption{The SSL handshake protocol}
    
\end{figure}

\vspace{5mm} %5mm vertical space
The SSL handshake protocol comprises four sets of messages:
\begin{itemize}
\item The first flight comprises a single \emph{ClientHello} message that is sent from the client to the server.
\item The second flight comprises two messages that are sent back from the server to the client:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{ServerHello} message is sent in response to the \emph{ClientHello} message
\item (optional) If the server is to authenticate itself, it may send a \emph{Certificate} message to the client.
\item (optional) Under some circumstances, the server may send a \emph{ServerKeyExchange} message to the client.
\item (optional) If the server requires the client to authenticate itself with a public key certificate, then it may send a \emph{CertificateRequest} message to the client.
\item Finally, server send a \emph{ServerHelloDone} message to the client.
\end{enumerate}
\item The third flight comprises three to five messages that are again sent from the client to the server:
\begin{enumerate}
\item (optional) If the server has sent a \emph{CertificateRequest} message, then the client sends a \emph{Certificate} message to the server.
\item In the main step of the protocol, the client sends a \emph{ClientKeyExchange} message to the server.
\item (optional) If the client has sent a certificate to the server, then it must also send a \emph{CertificateVerify} message to the server. This message is digitally signed with the private key that corresponds to the client certificate's public key.
\item The client sends a \emph{ChangeCipherSpec} message to the server (using the SSL change cipher spec protocol) and copies its pending write state into the current write state.
\item The client sends a \emph{Finished} message to the server. As mentioned above, this is the first message that is cryptographically protected under the new cipher spec.
\end{enumerate}
\item The fourth flight comprises two messages that are sent from the server back to the client:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The server sends another \emph{ChangeCipherSpec} message to the client and copies its pending write state into the current write state.
\item Finally, the server send a \emph{Finished} message to the client. Again, this message is cryptographically protected under the new cipher spec.

\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

At this point in time, the SSL handshake is complete and the client and server may start exchanging application-layer data.

In this example, the server is a simple SSL server that allows only one client connection; after the connection with a client, the server receives an encrypted message from client, it responds and quits.
\\The -b parameter allows the server to bind to any interface instead of localhost only.
\\
\\The client after the connection with the server, sends a message (hello wolfssl!) and after the server response, it quits.
\\The -h parameter allows the client to specify the server address to perform the connection.

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}
Client IP:  192.168.0.47 \hspace{4cm} Server IP: 192.168.0.53\\ \\
As you can see from the figure above, the communication is initialized from client with a 'Client Hello'; after SSL handshake, there are 2 messages 'Application Data' sent respectively from the client to the server and from the server to the client whose content is encrypted. Once the server sends a response to the client, the communication is closed.

\section{TCP application}
To create an SSL program you can modify your TCP program added several SSL functions. To explain the migration from TCP to SSL, I created a simple chat between a client and a server. The code of this program isn't reported in this text but it is available on github.

\vspace{5mm} %5mm vertical space
Above there are some wireshark screenshot to see the data traffic of a tcp application; these images with the next sections allow to understand the difference between an application with or without encryption.

\subsection{TCP Server}

In my example, the TCP server after configuring the socket and connecting it with the client, it creates a ClientHandler thread that launches a thread for read and a thread for write from socket.
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={int main() of TCP server},captionpos=b][language=c]

int main()
{
    /* Create a socket that uses an internet IPv4 address,
     * Sets the socket to be stream based (TCP),
     * 0 means choose the default protocol. */
    if ((sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0)) == -1)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "ERROR: failed to create the socket\n");
        return -1;
    }

    /* Initialize the server address struct with zeros */
    memset(&servAddr, 0, sizeof(servAddr));

    /* Fill in the server address */
    servAddr.sin_family = AF_INET;           /* using IPv4      */
    servAddr.sin_port = htons(DEFAULT_PORT); /* on DEFAULT_PORT */
    servAddr.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;   /* from anywhere   */

    /* Bind the server socket to our port */
    if (bind(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *)&servAddr, sizeof(servAddr)) == -1)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "ERROR: failed to bind\n");
        return -1;
    }

    /* Listen for a new connection*/
    if (listen(sockfd, 1) == -1)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "ERROR: failed to listen\n");
        return -1;
    }
    /* Continue to accept clients until shutdown is issued */
    while (1)
    {
        printf("Waiting for a connection...\n");
        /* Accept client connections */
        if ((connd = accept(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *)&clientAddr, &size)) == -1)
        {
            fprintf(stderr, "ERROR: failed to accept the connection\n\n");
            ncurses_end();
            return -1;
        }
        pthread_t mainThread;
        pthread_create(&mainThread, NULL, ClientHandler, NULL);
        pthread_join(mainThread, NULL);
        printText("Communication is ended!\n", "System");

        if (is_end)
            break;
    }
    ncurses_end();
    printf("Shutdown complete\n");

    /* Cleanup after this connection */
    close(connd); /* Close the connection to the client   */
    /* Cleanup and return */
    close(sockfd); /* Close the socket listening for clients   */
    return 0;      /* Return reporting a success               */
}

\end{lstlisting}

As stated above, the clientHandler thread creates two thread, but before it waits the client username.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={clientHandler thread of TCP server},captionpos=b][language=c]
void *ClientHandler(void *args)
{
    int ret;
    /*********************** USERNAME */
    /* Read the client username into our buff array */
    XMEMSET(buff, 0, sizeof(buff));
    ret = read(connd, buff, sizeof(buff));
    ncurses_start();
    clearWin();
    if (ret > 0)
    {
        /* Print to stdout any data the client sends */
        strcpy(username, buff);
        char text[256];
        sprintf(text, "Client %s connected successfully", username);
        printText(text, "System");
        printText("***************************\n", "System");
        fflush(stdout);
    }
    else
    {
        printText("ERROR!!", "System");
        close(sockfd);      /* Close the connection to the server   */
        pthread_exit(NULL); /* End theread execution                */
    }
    /****************************    */
    XMEMSET(buff, 0, sizeof(buff));

    if (pthread_create(&Treader, NULL, readBuffer, NULL))
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error creating thread\n");
        fflush(stdout);
        return NULL;
    }

    if (pthread_create(&Twriter, NULL, writeBuffer, NULL))
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error creating thread\n");
        fflush(stdout);
        return NULL;
    }
    pthread_join(Treader, NULL);
    pthread_join(Twriter, NULL);
    /* Cleanup after this connection */
    close(connd);       /* Close the connection to the client   */
    pthread_exit(NULL); /* End theread execution                */
}

\end{lstlisting}


ReadBuffer is a thread that allows to read messages sent from client. It has an infinite loop that read data from socket open previously; Once it gets the message, with the printText function, the message is printed to the terminal using ncurses. 
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={readBuffer thread of TCP server},captionpos=b][language=c]
void *readBuffer(void *args)
{
    int ret;
    while (1)
    {
        /* Read the client data into our buff array */
        XMEMSET(buffReader, 0, sizeof(buffReader));
        ret = read(connd, buffReader, sizeof(buffReader));

        if (ret > 0)
        {
            if (!strcmp(buffReader, "quit"))
            {
                pthread_cancel(Twriter);
                pthread_exit(NULL); /* End threaded execution                */
            }
            printText(buffReader, username);
        }
        else
        {
            printText("ERROR READ!!", "System");
            pthread_cancel(Twriter);
            pthread_exit(NULL); /* End threaded execution                */
        }
    }
}

\end{lstlisting}
WriteBuffer thread has an infinite loop used for write messages from server to client.
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={writeBuffer thread of TCP server},captionpos=b][language=c]
void *writeBuffer(void *args)
{
    int ret;
    while (1)
    {
        read_in();
        len = XSTRLEN(Rbuffer);

        /* Reply back to the client */
        ret = write(connd, Rbuffer, len);
        printText(Rbuffer, "Server");

        if (XSTRNCMP(Rbuffer, "quit", 4) == 0)
        {
            is_end = 1;
            break;
        }

        if (ret != len)
        {
            printText("ERROR!!", "System");
            break;
        }
    }
    pthread_cancel(Treader);
    return NULL;
}

\section{From TCP to SSL}
To create a wolfSSL application the first thing that I did is include the wolfSSL API header in my program.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=c]
#include <wolfssl/ssl.h>
\end{lstlisting}
After the inclusion of the header files, I initialize the library and the WOLFSSL\_CTX calling \textbf{wolfSSL\_Init}; This is necessary to use the library.
\\\\ The WOLFSSL\_CTX structure contains global values for each SSL connection, including certificate information.
To create a new WOLFSSL\_CTX there is \textbf{wolfSSL\_CTX\_new()} function. It requires an argument which defines the SSL or TLS protocol for the client or server to use. In my case I used TLS 1.3, so the call is: 
\begin{lstlisting}[language=c]
WOLFSSL_CTX *ctx = wolfSSL_CTX_new(wolfTLSv1_3_server_method());
\end{lstlisting}
for the server;
\begin{lstlisting}[language=c]
WOLFSSL_CTX *ctx = wolfSSL_CTX_new(wolfTLSv1_3_client_method())
\end{lstlisting}
for the client.
\\\\In the WOLFSSL\_CTX can be loaded the CA (Certificate Authority) so that the client is able to verify the server's identity when they start the connection. To load the CA into the WOLFSSL\_CTX there is \\\textbf{wolfSSL\_CTX\_load\_verify\_locations()}. This function requires three arguments:
\begin{itemize}
\item a WOLFSSL\_CTX pointer
\item a certificate file
\item a path value that point to a directory which should contain CA certificates in PEM format.
\end{itemize}
this function returns SSL\_SUCCESS or SSL\_FAILURE.
\\\textbf{wolfSSL\_CTX\_load\_verify\_locations()} can be used for verify the certificate of the servers by the client.
\\The server loads a certificate file into the SSL context (WOLFSSL\_CTX) calling:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=c]
int wolfSSL_CTX_use_certificate_file(ctx, CERT_FILE, SSL_FILETYPE_PEM);
\end{lstlisting}
Then the server must load private key with:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=c]
int wolfSSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey_file(ctx, KEY_FILE, SSL_FILETYPE_PEM)
\end{lstlisting}

After a TCP connection the WOLFSSL object needs to be created and the file descriptor needs to be associated with the session; the instructions are:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=c]
//Connect to socket file descriptor
WOLFSSL* ssl;
//create WOLFSSL object
ssl = wolfSSL_new(ctx);
wolfSSL_set_fd(ssl,sockfd);
\end{lstlisting}
After the previous instructions called by client and server, the server waits an SSL client to initiate the SSL handshake; it waits until a client call \textbf{wolfSSL\_connect(ssl)} and then the handshake starts.
\\\\Once the connection functions are set, I replaced \textbf{read(...)} function with: 
\begin{lstlisting}[language=c]
int wolfSSL_read(WOLFSSL *ssl, void *data, int sz);
\end{lstlisting}
It read \textbf{sz} bytes from the SSL session \textbf{ssl} internal read buffer into the buffer \textbf{data}. The bytes are removed from the internal receive buffer;
\\\\Instead the \textbf{write(...)} function is replaced by:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=c]
int wolfSSL_write(WOLFSSL *ssl, void *data, int sz);
\end{lstlisting}
It writes \textbf{sz} bytes from the buffer, \textbf{data}, to the SSL connection, \textbf{ssl}.
\\\\When the application is over, the WOLFSSL\_CTX object and the wolfSSL library must be freed; the instructions are:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=c]
wolfSSL_free(ssl);
wolfSSL_CTX_free(ctx);
wolfSSL_Cleanup();
\end{lstlisting}

\pagebreak
\section{SSL application}
To develop an SSL application, I started from the TCP chat explained in the previous section and I added the wolfSSL function to create an encrypted communication.
\\The goal of this program is to show how to create a simple encrypted chat, focusing on the security of an application and not to the good practices of the socket and thread applications.
\\Some part of the code like inclusion and global variables are omitted (wolfSSL object and other variables are stored in global memory); 
\\In the next subsections I'll try to explain the code of the program:
\subsection{SSL Server}
For testing purpose, all the certificates that I use and the server private key, I took them from wolfSSL download.
\\After the initialization of the wolfSSL and the socket, the main function marks the socket referred to by sockfd as a passive socket, that is, as a socket that will be used to accept incoming connection requests using accept.
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={int main() of SSL server, 1* part},captionpos=b][language=c]
int main()
{
    int ret;

    /* Initialize wolfSSL */
    wolfSSL_Init();

    /* Create a socket that uses an internet IPv4 address,
     * Sets the socket to be stream based (TCP),
     * 0 means choose the default protocol. */
    if ((sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0)) == -1)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "ERROR: failed to create the socket\n");
        return -1;
    }
    /* Create and initialize WOLFSSL_CTX */

This server can communicate with one client at a time so there is an infinite loop where the connection with a client is established. At this point a mainThread is created to handle reading and writing through the secure channel. Whenever the connection falls, the thread ends and the server try to established a new connection. The server ends only when keyboard of the server type 'quit' (this part is in another function).

\subsection{SSL Client}
The SSL client has 3 thread; The main function creates Tclient thread that is used to manage read and write threads.
\\To execute the SSL client, the program needs the IP address of server. If the user doesn't provide it during the program calls, the program ends.

Reading and writing threads are similar to the server part, so I'm not putting them in this text.

\section{Compile a WolfSSL program}
To execute a wolfSSL program you must have installed wolfSSL on your pc, and then you must add \textbf{-lwolfssl} on your gcc command.
\\In this program I used threads and ncurses so I had to add \textbf{-pthread} and \textbf{-lncurses} flags to gcc command; to optimize the compilation I created a makefile.

\section{Execute a WolfSSL program}
In my project I used a laptop for the client part, and a Raspberry Pi for the server part; they are connected to the same LAN.
\\Below you can see the GUI of the client and the server part, and the traffic analyze with wireshark.
\\The IP address of server is \textbf{192.168.0.53} and the port is \textbf{11111}.
\\The IP address of client is \textbf{192.168.0.46}\\

    \caption{Execute WolfSSL client}
    
\end{figure}

After the execution of the server, a client can connect to it and the ssl handshake starts.
\\With the hello packet below, the client provides an ordered list of 27 cipher suites that it will support for encryption. The list is in the order preferred by the client, with highest preference first. This list can be modified by the programmer.
\\In this case, the client provides a list of optional extension which the server can use to take action or enable new features, for example:
\begin{itemize}
\item key\_share 
\begin{itemize}
\item the client sends one or more public keys using an algorithm that it thinks the server will support. This allows the rest of the handshake after the ClientHello message to be encrypted.
\end{itemize}
\item supported\_version
\begin{itemize}
\item the client indicates its support of TLS 1.3
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.248]{./code/img/client-hello.png}
    \caption{Client Hello}
    
\end{figure}


In the Server Hello packet, the server has selected cipher suite 0x1301 (TLS\_AES\_128\_GCM\_SHA256) from the list of options given by the client.
\\The server sends also a public key using the algorithm of the public key sent by the client. Once this is sent,the rest of the communication will be encrypted.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.248]{./code/img/server-hello.png}
    \caption{Server Hello}
    
\end{figure}
\pagebreak

After the SSL handshake the situation in the server GUI is:

    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{./code/img/2-server.png}
    \caption{Client connected, server GUI}
    
\end{figure}

\pagebreak
To test the exact function of the programs, I sent several messages between the laptop and the raspberry:
\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[scale=0.20]{./code/img/2-client.png}

    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.44]{./code/img/3-server.png}
    \caption{Exchange messages. Server side}

As you can see, the messages are encrypted.

\chapter{Differences between WolfSSL and OpenSSL}
\section{Differences}

The main differences are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Memory Usage
\begin{itemize}
\item WolfSSL can be up to 20 times smaller than OpenSSL; The build size is between 20 and 100 KB and the runtime memory usage between 1 and 36 KB. This gives a magior advantage of integrating in smaller embedded devices. 
\end{itemize}
\item Hardware Crypto
\begin{itemize}
\item WolfSSL has a partnership with the most MCU manufacturers which allows to be quite early in the market to support hardware acceleration on huge list of platforms.
\end{itemize}
\item Portability
\begin{itemize}
\item WolfSSL is more portable than OpenSSL because is made for real-time, mobile, embedded and enterprise systems.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Build size and speed test}
I installed openSSL and wolfSSL in a Raspberry Pi 4 and I could see the difference in occupancy on disk:
\\OpenSSL occupies 412.5 MB while wolfSSL only 47 MB. This difference also affects the compilation and installation time; WolfSSL is compiled and installed in about 3 minutes while openSSL takes at least 10 minutes.
\\\\Wolfssl is definitely made for embedded systems, but how much can the data forwarding performance differ?
\\To answer this question I created two program that exchange data between a Raspberry and a laptop, one for wolfSSL and one for openSSL. In the specification, one of the two reads a file and sends the read content to the other one.
The two programs are identical, the only difference are the function calls. One program has the functions of openssl and the other of wolfssl.
\\For the wolfSSL I used the same certificates and key used in the previous program, while for the openSSL I created a root CA certificate, a server key and a certificate signing request with these commands:
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={openSSL commands},captionpos=b][language=bash]
openssl genrsa -des3 -out CA-key.pem 2048
openssl req -new -key CA-key.pem -x509 -days 1000 -out CA-cert.pem
openssl genrsa -des3 -out server-key.pem 2048
openssl req â€“new â€“config openssl.cnf â€“key server-key.pem â€“out signingReq.csr
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in signingReq.csr -CA CA-cert.pem -CAkey CA-key.pem -CAcreateserial -out server-cert.pem
\end{lstlisting}

I created these programs to measure the data forwarding time.
\\The functions under examination are:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={openSSL function},captionpos=b][language=c]
void writefile(SSL *ssl, FILE *fp)
{
    ssize_t n;
    char buff[MAX_LINE] = {0};
    clock_t t; 
    t = clock(); 
    while ((n = SSL_read(ssl, buff, sizeof(buff))) > 0)
    {
        total += n;
        if (n == -1)
        {
            perror("Receive File Error");
            exit(1);
        }

        if (fwrite(buff, sizeof(char), n, fp) != n)
        {
            perror("Write File Error");
            exit(1);
        }
        memset(buff, 0, MAX_LINE);
    }
    t = clock() - t; 
    double time_taken = ((double)t)/CLOCKS_PER_SEC; // in seconds 
    printf("%f seconds to receive data \n", time_taken); 
}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={wolfSSL function},captionpos=b][language=c]
void writefile(WOLFSSL *ssl, FILE *fp)
{
    ssize_t n;
    char buff[MAX_LINE] = {0};
    clock_t t;
    t = clock();
    while ((n = wolfSSL_read(ssl, buff, sizeof(buff))) > 0)
    {
        total += n;
        if (n == -1)
        {
            perror("Receive File Error");
            exit(1);
        }
        if (fwrite(buff, sizeof(char), n, fp) != n)
        {
            perror("Write File Error");
            exit(1);
        }
        memset(buff, 0, MAX_LINE);
    }
    t = clock() - t;
    double time_taken = ((double)t) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC; // in seconds
    printf("%f seconds to receive data \n", time_taken);
}
\end{lstlisting}
The rest of the code is on github.
\\\\For the following test I created 3 files size about 100 MB, 500 MB and 1 GB with these commands:

This test is made in my gigabit home network.
The time is in seconds. (time also includes writing the file)
\\The cipher suite used is: TLS\_ECDHE\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_256\_GCM\_SHA384

OpenSSL is more performing than wolfssl; the difference of time is relevant.
Only by sending large amounts of data you can see the difference between them, but wolfSSL being born for embedded systems works very well and above all it takes up less space.
